{"name":"TerraFERMA","tagline":"The Transparent Finite Element Rapid Model Assembler","body":"THIS SITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION - COME BACK SOON...\r\n\r\nTerraFERMA is the *Transparent Finite Element Rapid Model Assembler*, a software system for the  rapid and reproducible construction and exploration of  coupled  multi-physics models.\r\n\r\nTerraFERMA leverages three advanced open-source libraries for scientific computation that provide high level problem description ([FEniCS](http://fenicsproject.org)), composable solvers for coupled multi-physics problems ([PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc)) and a science neutral options handling system ([SPuD] (http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/earthscienceandengineering/research/amcg/spud)) that allows the hierarchical management of all model options.\r\n\r\nTerraFERMA inherits most of its functionality from the underlying libraries but adds a layer of control and guidance for building reusable and reproducible applications.\r\n\r\nFurther discussion, installation instructions and documentation can be found on the [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/tferma/tferma/wiki/).\r\n\r\n## License\r\nTerraFERMA is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the as\r\npublished by the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org), either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nTerraFERMA is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
